"Welcome to Shell Scripting Lectures"
if you want to print a message for multiple times, we will use 'Loop' concept

What is a loop?
Loops are used to execute the same statement multiple times
Used to repeat a set of commands until a condition is satisfied

Types of Loops;
1. Range based loop - if you already know how many times you want to execute a statement then we will use 'Range based loop'
						Ex: for
2. Conditional based loop - if you dont know the range and you want to execute a statement until the condition the is true then we will use 'Conditional based loop'
						Ex: while

FOR Loop
------------------
Syntax

for (( initialization; condition; modification ))
	do
		<Statements>
done
vi numbers.sh------------

#! /bin/bash
for(( k=1; k<=15; k++ ))
   do
   echo $k
   done
 
 vi numbersr.sh-----------
 
 #! /bin/bash
 for((k=15; k>=1; k--))
 do
 echo $k
 done
 
 particular file will be iddentified in this way===========
 
 #! /bin/bash
for file in *.txt; do
        echo "Text file name: $file"
done

Total all files findout dcript is....

#! /bin/bash
for file name in *; do
        echo "Text file name: $file name"

done





WHILE Loop
---------------------------
while loop is used to execute until the condition is true

Syntax

while [ condition ]
do
	<Statements>
done

 vi while.sh----------------------------------
#! /bin/bash
# Ask for a password until the correct password is entered

  password="secret"
  user_input=""
  
  while [ "$user_input" != "$password" ]
  do 
       echo "Enter correct Password;"
	   read user_input
  done
  echo "Acess Granted!!"  

vi while1.sh--------------------- if we come out of loop (ctrl=c)
 want to print the values from 1-15
 using while loop
 
#!/bin/bash
K=1
while [ $K -le 15 ]
do 
    echo $K
done

then we can execute we got 1111111111111 upto 15 digits only ones bcz we cant specify arthematic expression 

#!/bin/bash
K=1
while [ $K -le 15 ]
do 
    echo $K
	let K++ (conditon clarity unlike above exercise)
done

vi while2.sh-----------
count down timer

#!/bin/base
#Countdown Loop File

counter=5
while [ $counter -ge 1 ]; do
       echo "Countdown: $counter"
	   counter=$((counter - 1))
	   sleep 2
done
echo "Bomb is Blasted"
